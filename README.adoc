== Overview

Asciidoctor can render a slide deck from an AsciiDoc with one command.

== How to render the slide deck

Clone this repo.

Run this command in the directory.

 Asciidoctor -T templates/slim index.txt

It will render a file called index.html

If that command doesn't build the reveal.js slide deck, make sure you have all the prerequisites
